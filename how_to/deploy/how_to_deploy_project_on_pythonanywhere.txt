How to deploy project on PythonAnywhere
=======================================

* Use pip to install Jam.py. To do this, open up a new **Bash** console from the **Consoles** Tab and run:

  .. code-block:: console
  
    mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.13 my-virtualenv  # use whichever python version you prefer
    pip install jam.py-v7


  The above **mkvirtualenv** command might display:
 
  .. code-block:: console  
  
      created virtual environment CPython3.10.5.final.0-64 in 8486ms
      creator CPython3Posix(dest=/home/username/.virtualenvs/my-virtualenv, ...


  The **dest** path is used for **Virtualenv** section. For every user, this will be different.
  
* Create a zip archive of your project folder, upload the archive in the **Files** 
  tab and unzip it.
  
  We assume that you are registered as *username* and your project is now located 
  in the */home/username/project_folder* directory.

* Open the **Web** Tab. Add a new web app. 
  In the **Code** section specify:

  * Source code: */home/username/project_folder*

  * Working directory: */home/username/project_folder*

  * WSGI configuration file: */var/www/username_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py* file,
  delete everything and add just the following code:

  .. code-block:: py

    import os
    import sys
    
    path = '/home/username/project_folder'
    if path not in sys.path:
        sys.path.append(path)
    
    from jam.wsgi import create_application
    application = create_application(path)



  In the **Static files** section, specify the Jam.py static files location and 
  the path. For example:

  
      * URL: */static/*
      * Directiory: */home/username/project_folder/static*
  

  In the **Virtualenv** section, specify the virtual environment path created
  with above **mkvirtualenv** command. For example:
  
      * /home/username/.virtualenvs/my-virtualenv/

  In the **Force HTTPS** section, enable HTTPS.


* Reload the server on **Reload** section.
* To debug the process, review the logs on **Logs** section.
